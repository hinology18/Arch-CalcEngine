CalcEngine
A web application that helps aspiring automotive engineers which I made to demonstrate and practice my python coding and Automotive engineering knowledge.

# CalcEngine

**CalcEngine** is an interactive web app for aspiring automotive engineers.  
It lets you explore Python coding while learning how F1 and sports cars actually work.

The code has **zero** errors or warnings

## Disclaimer

This isn’t MATLAB or any professional engineering tool.  
It’s just a project I made to challenge myself and apply what I’ve learned in Python and automotive engineering.  
It’s meant to be educational and fun, not industry-level software.

**THE GRAPH SECTION IS SOMETHING I CANCELLED DUE TO A LACK OF PROPER YOUTUBE TUTORIALS AND NOT WANTING TO RELY ON AI PLEASE IGNORE IT**

## Features 

CalcEngine has three main sections:
1. **F1 Car Section** – Explore calculations specific to Formula 1 cars.  
2. **Sports Car Section** – Learn how high-performance road cars behave using real-world physics.
3.

## Previous Plans 

I wanted to add **hyper car** and **muscle car** explanations and calculations, but ran out of time and decided to focus on F1 and sports cars.  
Also, most brands like Bugatti don’t share their tech publicly, unlike F1 where information is much more accessible.  
This let me go deeper into F1 and still learn a lot about sports cars.

## Self - Reflection

Working on this project showed me just how much effort goes into making a car perform properly.  
The calculations in CalcEngine barely scratch the surface of real automotive engineering, but it helped me understand the concepts and apply Python in a practical environment
However, I'm aware it is also mainly text based with a huge lack of images. Next time, i'll be prioritising organisation and efficiency with diagrams and a **CAD** model. Which is the
foundation for engineering.
